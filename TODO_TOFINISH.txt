1. Parse ISO2709 into fields by interpreting the Directory.

2. Reconstruct fields into ISO2709.

3. Turn 1 & 2 into lossless round trip.

4. LDR:   Get length and make sure it works. (hack as necessary...)

5. LDR length computation based on raw.

6. Finish the round trip marc21 ISO 2709: turn an ISO 2709 example into a raw form, and a raw form into ISO 2709. Lossless roundtrip.

7. Check form against MARCEdit.

8. Make the Web Service use it.

9. FIX: change FOREACH output into a list of subfields. Then fix serializations to use proper output.

10. AWESOME: make XML output serialization from raw

11. AWESOMER: make XML in-memory Document in lieu of Raw.
