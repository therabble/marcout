The Web service can be launched manually, but for convenience, there's the
`marcout-service` bash script.

FROM THE ROOT OF YOUR COPY OF THIS REPO:
`./marcout-service`

Note that you DO NOT have to be in a command window with the virtual
environment activated, because `marcout-service` ensures that the environment
is activated before launching the service.
